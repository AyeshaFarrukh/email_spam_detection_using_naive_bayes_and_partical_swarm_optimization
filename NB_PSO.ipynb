( 1 ) janhunen says that the probability of a match occurring purely by chance when you compare japanese with four languages is four times what it is when you compare it with one language . this simply cannot be true because probabilities are values between 0 and 1 . if the probablity in the case of a binary comparison was say . 5 , then he would be predicting that it would be 2 in the case of n-ary comparison , which is impossible , because 2 is not between 0 and 1 . ( 2 ) the other fallacy is not purely mathematical , although i suspect that it involves elements of confusio . in any case , no one who argues for n-ary comparison ever talks about getting a match in 2 out of n languages . now , if we look at guy 's numbers , in his scenario of a 100 - word list with no shifted meanings , he came up with 14 . 5 probable spurious mathces in a binary comparison but only 5 . 8 when you are looking for a match between 3 out of 5 languages , 0 . 13 when you look for one between 4 out of 5 , and he does not give the much smaller number yet in the case of 5 out of 5 . i am not sure how jacques defines spurious and so i have not verified the numbers , but they are certainly on the right orders of magnitude . as you consider more and more languages ( also as the initial probability of a match declines , which usually happens as you go from toy models to real data ) , what happens is that you need fewer and fewer out of the n languages being compared to agree . thus , in guy 's example a match between n - 2 languages out of 5 was less likely to occur by chance than one between 2 out of 2 . but if n were 100 , i . e . , you were comparing 100 languages , then you would not need n - 2 ( i . e . , 98 ) languages to agree to be able to do better than with a binary comparison . it would be many many fewer ( although i do n't know how many since i do not know what formula jacques is using and what he is assuming about the initial probability of a match ) . maybe , he could kindly supply the numbers . and in light of all this , let us add another argument for rejecting indo - european : bopp never offered a mathematical demonstration that the relationships he proposed were unlikely to be due to chance , much less by doing a binary comparison of every pair of indo - european languages . which i think just goes to show how unrealistic the whole idea of doing such comparisons is . but if you do want to do them , then at least let us be clear about how to do them so as to minimize false positives ( i . e . matches due to chance and not really reflective of common origin ) as well as false negatives ( i . e . , failures to find genuine historical connections ) . on the second point , there are arguments that n-ary is better . alexis mr\\n\",\n          \"hello thanks for stopping by !

fortunately the ' 501 deal ' was more common and so it was a lot easier to figure out the meaning of the second sentence . a few people thought the 501 might be a car . this possibility had crossed our minds too . after having looked it up in a car encycopedia and having consulted a local peugeot dealer , indeed a 301 , a 401 , and a 601 , and even a 504 , turned out to exist ; a peugeot 501 , however , just does n o t exist ! so this solution had to be ruled out . the great majority of the respondents told us , that 501 refers to the popular button-fly levi 's blue jeans with straight legs . in holland this type of jeans is familiar also , but we did n't understand the \\\" major used - 501 deal \\\" in this context : \\\" what 's the big deal in selling worn blue jeans ? \\\" however , most respondents from the u . s . , but also from european countries , told us , that it is very popular to buy and sell used 501 's in the us . apparently young people are willing to pay much money for used jeans , because they are more comfortable ( less stiff ) and because they look more ' hip ' than the new ones . many companies buy used 501 's and after that they are sold from stores ( e . g . , on melrose ave . in l . a . there are at least half a dozen of these stores ) . besides that , there 's a huge ( black ) market , in which case people sell 501 's out of the back of cars or vans in parking lots or other public places . there might also be a foreign market for used 501 's , as rumour has it that used 501 's are also shipped off to paris , london , the far east ( japan ) and eastern europe . because so many people reacted , we cannot quote them all . so we have made a selection . as some of the respondents preferred not to be mentioned by name , we decided to not mention anyone by name . at the end of this recital we will give a short conclusion . . 501 's , what 's it all about \\\" 501 's are a style of blue jeans made by levi strauss and co . 501 's are , i believe , the best-selling style of levi 's . they are button-fly ( as opposed to the kind you zip up ) , and have 5 pockets . they are the kind of jeans people think of when they think of jeans . here in the us , used 501 's are worth more than other kinds of used jeans - - in college towns , you ' ll often see signs in vintage clothing stores specifically saying something like \\\" cash for used 501 's . \\\" before perestroika , there was a big black market demand in russia for jeans of any kind . levi 's were the prestige brand ; i do n't know the location in time and space of your narrative , but perhaps the deal is shady . a major deal involving used jeans ( which here can be bought new on sale for $ 20 , and used , might fetch the original owner $ 10 in a vintage store ) must then be a negotiation about a truck full of jeans or so . many pairs would be needed to make the cash involved a major deal . \\\" . used - 501 sale vs . used - 501 deal \\\" used 501 's are becoming in recent years more and more popular among the youth of this country , hence the rise in shops and vendors that deal exclusively in these used products . _ a used - 501 deal _ is most likely an informal street sale ( not through a well-established shop , in which case it would be called a _ sale _ ) of used jeans , especially levi brand jeans ' \\\" . witnessing a 501 deal \\\" so the sentence could mean either the speaker witnessed someone purchase used ( previously owned ) 501 's , with 'd eal ' meaning ' ( business ) transaction ' , or 'd eal ' could mean ' bargain ' , that the jeans were being sold for less than usual . the fact that the speaker uses the verb ' witness ' would seem to remove him from the action , so perhaps the first interpretation is best . \\\" . cowboys like their 501 's blue and stiff \\\" i recently read an article about a company who buys used blue jeans from real cowboys and sells them at a very high price to people in places like new york city . ( cowboys , of which my brother-in - law is one , do n't wear their jeans when they start to fade , they like them blue and stiff . ) \\\" . a used - 501 deal \\\" i ' m inspired to write by a sign i saw a few minutes ago , while driving home from the office . it announced that a merchant would pay up to $ 17us for \\\" used 501s . \\\" \\\" 501 \\\" refers to a style of blue jeans - what my grandmother used to call dungarees - manufactured by the levi strauss co . all their style numbers are numbers between 500 and 600 . 501 is a popular style among young persons , featuring a button-fly and straight legs . i ' m no longer young enough for 501s ; i must wear 512s , which have a fuller leg and seat . tomorrow , i ' m going to take all my old , unwearable 501s and trade them for $ 17us each . i 'd say that a \\\" major used - 501 deal \\\" is either a transaction such as the one i ' m proposing for tomorrow or , because \\\" deal \\\" is sometimes used more generically , somewhat like \\\" thing \\\" , a place of business where such transactions take place . \\\" . major 501 price , major 501 place or major 501 transaction \\\" \\\" a major used - 501 deal \\\" no doubt refers to one of those temporary locations where people offer to buy used levi 501 jeans for around $ 8 , with the intention of re-selling them elsewhere . \\\" deal \\\" is so inarticulate a word that it 's not possible to tell you definitively what is meant , apart from more context . ( 1 ) my best guess is that it relates to \\\" getting a good deal \\\" for your used 501 jeans , that is , getting a good price for them . the scenario i have constructed is that someone wants to point out a place where you can get good money by selling your used 501 jeans . ( 2 ) if it does n't have to do with getting a price for used jeans , it might refer to the physical characteristics of the business place itself . this particular temporary storefront may be larger or more conspicuous than usual . in that scenario , someone wants to point out a larger-than - usual 501 jeans stand . ( \\\" a major used - 501 whatchamacallit : stand , storefront , business \\\" ) ( 3 ) last scenario : someone witnessed a major jeans-selling transaction . he wants to describe someone 's having brought in and sold a large quantity of 501 jeans to the jeans buyer . to be brief here are three possible paraphrases for \\\" a major used - 501 deal \\\" . 1 . \\\" a place where they give you a much better-than - average price for your used 501 jeans \\\" 2 . \\\" a large or impressive used - 501 jeans stand \\\" 3 . \\\" a single business transaction involving the buying and selling of a large lot of 501 jeans \\\" \\\" . conclusion in reference to the last respondent , somehow we felt most comfortable with the third paraphrase , mainly because according to most of the other respondents a business t r a n s a c t i o n was involved here and because according to our own intuition ' to witness ' - - at least when it means ' to see sth . ' - - always goes with an object , expressing an a c t i o n rather than a s t a t e . in the case of the ' 501 deal ' this means that the one who uttered the sentence , s a w that a 501 actually w a s b e i n g sold and because he speaks of a major deal , he saw a lot of 501s being sold at once . so , in our opinion : \\\" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a major used - 501 deal . \\\" can best be paraphrased into : \\\" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a business transaction involving a large stock of used levi 's 501 . \\\" if someone still feels uncomfortable with this transcription , please do n't hesitate to send your reaction to wimk @ zeus . cs . kun . nl . thanks again for all your contributions . many regards , wim koole , also on behalf of janny koole - loonstra nijmegen holland\\n\",\n          \"several people submitted \\\" overlook \\\" and \\\" oversight \\\" , which are fine examples of this phenomenon in english ( though i think that mary neff 's \\\" outgoing : retiring \\\" is perhaps the most elegant submission to date . ) perhaps my current work on the various shades of meaning in english prepositions has biased me , but in any case i think that the difference in the various senses of \\\" oversight \\\" and \\\" overlook \\\" stems largely from their compounding with \\\" over - \\\" . \\\" over \\\" is sneaky ; at first glance it seems to be fairly limited in expressive power , but deeper analysis reveals that in it lurk a number of distinctions of meaning , some of them quite subtle indeed . in addition to nuances of physical location , \\\" over \\\" can indicate power relationships ( both outright force , and more subtle authority ) , value judgements , and the general notion of ( metaphorically ) moving on to another thing , as in \\\" get over it \\\" and \\\" skip over \\\" . so my analysis of \\\" oversight \\\" and \\\" overlook \\\" would be that in one sense , \\\" over \\\" takes on the meaning of authority-over , and in the other sense it takes on the meaning of skipping-over . perhaps a similar argument could be make for the \\\" sight / see / look \\\" part of the compound ? for instance , useages such as \\\" see to it \\\" \\\" look to your own interest \\\" seem to carry some of this \\\" authority \\\" meaning . i think the \\\" over \\\" analysis is more clear-cut , but it would be interesting to see if someone will make a case for the other half . - - marion kee marion kee | all opinions are my own ; knowledge engineer , center for machine translation | when cmu wants my opinions carnegie mellon university pittsburgh , pa , usa | it pays for them .\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2401,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
